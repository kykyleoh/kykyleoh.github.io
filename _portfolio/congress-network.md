<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This project was the final project output for Network Science class under Professor Erika Legara in the AIM Msc Data Science program. In this project, we map the voting network of the House of Representatives and Senate of the United States Congress across all rollcall votes from 1947-2019. <b>Using network analysis tools, we show the rise of bipartisanship among the Republican and Democratic parties and specifically, the effect of the Obama and Trump administrations to the voting patterns of the United States Congress.</b></p>
