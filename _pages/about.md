I'm a data scientist from Manila, Philippines who loves solving problems across multi-disciplinary fields. This website serves as a personal space where I can publish some of my interesting work as well as a vehicle for me to share some of my thoughts! I'll try my best to blog here as well and share my journey as I (hopefully) explore different facts in deep learning, macrosimulation, automation, and whatever other things I may be trying to learn at a given time.
