excerpt: <img src='/images/kyleohbytes/kyleohbytes.png'><br>Welcome to KyleohBytes, a new avenue to explore my thoughts on concepts and mental frameworks for data science. This is where I try to discuss concepts in data science grounded on my own understanding and mental models. I've always loved to learn new things and data science is just the gift that keeps on giving; there are so many things to learn but at the end of the day, I always believe that a solid grasp of fundamental concepts goes a long way. So welcome! Hopefully I'll shed some light on some of these core concepts and maybe have a little bit of fun along the way.
